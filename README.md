This project evauates factors that lead to employee turnover/attrition at a large biotechnology company
There was extensive data transformation and preliminary evaluation of score distributions
We evaluated the relationship among variables using correlation, chi-square, and pca
We reduced the initial list of potential predictors of attrition by t-test and chi-sq
