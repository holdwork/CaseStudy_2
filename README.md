# CaseStudy_2
Data science second project
This project evauates factors that lead to employee turnover/attrition at a large biotechnology company
There was extensive data transformation and preliminary evaluation of score distributions and descriptive statistics
Variables with no or limited information were excluded
We evaluated the relationship among variables using correlation, chi-square, and pca
We reduced the initial list of potential predictors of attrition by t-test and chi-sq
we created new variables by creating factor scores based on results of pca and new variables representing interaction terms
We created training and test data sets (75% vs 25%) with a set.seed to allow for replication of findings
we applied logistic regression model using GLM and also MLR. Results were similar betwwen approaches
we provided extensive graphical displays of trends in the company
